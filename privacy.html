                <p>Pluckphoto inc. (“Pluckphoto,” “we,” or “us”) is concerned about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through websites operated by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (the “Websites”), through the software applications made available by us for use on or through computers and mobile devices (the “Apps”), as well as through HTML-formatted email messages that we send to you that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, including the Websites and the Apps, the “Services”). By providing Personal Information to us, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h2>Personal Information</h2>

                <h3>Information we may collect</h3>
                <p>“Personal Information” is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable person. We and our service providers may collect Personal Information including:</p>

                <p>We may use a third-party payment service to process payments made through the Services. If you wish to make a payment through the Services, your Personal Information may be collected by the third party, and not by us, and will be subject to such third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, such third party’s collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information.</p>

                <p>If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h3>How we may collect personal information</h3>

For example, if you elect to connect your social media account to your Website account, certain Personal Information from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include Personal Information that is part of your profile or your friends’ profiles on that social media service (or another linked service).</p>

                <h3>How we may collect other information</h3>

                <h4>Through your browser or device</h4>
                <p>Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the Services (such as the App) you are using. We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.</p>

                <h4>Through your use of the app</h4>
                <p>When you download and use the App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.</p>

                <h4>Using cookies</h4>
                <p>Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data. We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the Services, as well as for online tracking purposes. We can recognize your computer to assist your use of the Services. We also gather statistical information about the usage of the Services in order to continually improve design and functionality, understand how the Services are used, and to assist us with resolving questions regarding the Services. We and our service providers may also use cookies to select which marketing emails are most likely to appeal to you based on your use of the Services, and may use cookies or other files to track your use of other websites. We do not respond to browser do-not-track signals at this time.</p>
                <p>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html. However, if you do not accept these cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer and you may need to log in every time you visit the applicable Services.</p>

                <h4>Google Analytics or other Google services</h4>
                <p>We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”).  This analytical tool uses cookies and similar technologies to help analyze how users use the Site.  You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. Google offers the ability to opt out from tracking through Google Analytics cookies; for more information, visit http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>

                <p>We use Google Display Network Impression Reporting to analyze users’ interactions with our ads. We also use Google services, including Google AdWords and Remarketing with Google Analytics, to advertise online, including for remarketing and interest-based advertising.  These services allow third-party vendors, including Google, to display our ads on third-party sites across the Internet.  We and our third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as Google advertising cookies) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to and activity on our Site and interactions with our ad impressions and ad services.  You can learn about Google’s practices and exercise additional opt-out choices offered by Google by visiting www.google.com/settings/ads.</p>

                <h4>Using pixel tags and other similar technologies</h4>
                <p>Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Services to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services and response rates.</p>

                <h4>IP address</h4>
                <p>Your “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels of the Services, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Services.</p>

                <h4>From you</h4>
                <p>We may collect demographic details (such as state of residence, gender, and age), as well as information you provide to us concerning your preferred means of communication and important dates (such as birthdays, wedding dates, and anniversary dates).</p>

                <h4>By aggregating information</h4>
                <p>Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services. (For example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code.)</p>

                <h4>How we may use and disclose other information</h4>
                <p>Please note that we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information. In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p>

                <h4>Third party services</h4>
                <p>This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site or service to which the Services link.

                <h4>Security</h4>
