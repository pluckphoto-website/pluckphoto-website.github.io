    <h3>5. Plucked Photos</h3>
    <FONT COLOR="#000000">
The Service is designed to automatically select (using our internal 
software) one photo from the photo gallery or library on your mobile 
device each month. Such selected photo will then be printed on photography 
grade paper and mailed to you (the “Free Photo”) at the address on file 
in your account along with selected advertising and marketing material 
we believe may be of interest to you. 
While the selection of the Free Photo is performed by our software’s formula, 
we use a third-party service to screen for inappropriate content in any Free 
Photo before it is sent to you. We reserve the right to change our screening 
method or criteria and/or to decline to print and mail any photo in our complete 
discretion. 
Although we use a screening formula to exclude graphic, explicit, or simply 
boring photos, we make no guarantees of any type that the Free Photo will not 
include any particular content, including illegal or inappropriate content. 
<b>If the photo is on your mobile device, there is a chance, despite the screening 
process, that it will be printed and mailed to your home at the address on file 
in your account. We are not responsible in any way for the consequences that may 
result.</b></FONT>
</P>
<P>
    <h3>6. Purchased Products</h3>
    <FONT COLOR="#000000">
Additionally, we make additional products, including printed photos from 
your mobile device, available for purchase from time to time (the 
&ldquo;Purchased Products&rdquo;). Any photos that you select and 
submit to use through the Service for printing and mailing to you are 
Purchased Products subject to this Agreement. If you wish to make a 
purchase, you may be asked to supply certain relevant information, 
such as details regarding your method of payment (e.g., your credit or 
debit card number and its expiration date, or select your payment 
service (e.g., PayPal)), your billing address, and your shipping 
information. You represent that you have the right to use any method of 
payment that you submit in connection with a purchase (e.g., credit card, 
debit card, or payment service). By submitting such information, you 
grant to us the right to provide such information to third parties 
for purposes of facilitating purchases. Verification of information 
may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any 
purchase. By making a purchase, you represent that the applicable 
Purchased Products will be used only in a lawful manner.</FONT>
</P>
<P>
    <FONT COLOR="#000000">Company
reserves the right to cancel any order that it deems, in its sole 
discretion, to include objectionable content or that may violate 
any of the terms of this Agreement, without any liability to you 
or any third party. In the event of any such cancellation, you will 
be refunded any amount actually received by Company for the cancelled 
order, less any applicable fees. You agree to pay all charges incurred 
by you or on your behalf through the Service, at the prices in effect 
when such charges are incurred, including all shipping and handling 
charges. In addition, you are responsible for any taxes applicable to 
your purchases. While it is our practice to confirm orders by email, 
the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute our 
acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a 
product or service. Purchased Products will be shipped to an address 
designated by you, if applicable, so long as such address is complete 
and complies with the shipping restrictions contained on the Service.</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000">If you have a Dispute with Company, you must send 
written notice describing the Dispute to Company to allow Company an opportunity 
to resolve the Dispute informally through negotiation. You must send your notice 
to the following address: pluckphoto, inc., 1320 Joliet Pl, Detroit, MI 48207. If 
we have a Dispute with you, we will send written notice (email or letter) describing 
the Dispute to you. The parties agree to negotiate resolution of a Dispute in good 
faith for no fewer than 45 days after notice of a Dispute has been provided. If the 
Dispute is not resolved within 45 days from receipt of notice of the Dispute, you or 
Company may proceed to have the Dispute resolved through arbitration as each party’s 
exclusive Dispute resolution process (except for the limited exceptions set forth above).
AAA under its then current and applicable rules and procedures, which are located at 
http://www.adr.org, and these rules will govern the payment of all filing, administration, 
and arbitrator fees, unless this Section 17 expressly provides otherwise. The party 
submitting a dispute for resolution through arbitration will pay AAA’s filing fee. 
Each party will pay their pro rata share of administration and arbitrator fees under 
AAA’s rules; provided however, if AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules are applicable, 
Company will make arrangements to pay all necessary administration and arbitrator 
fees directly to AAA.  If AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules are applicable and you 
lose the claim(s) you assert against Company, you agree to reimburse Company for your 
pro rata share of administration and arbitrator fees; provided however, if you are able 
to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the 
costs of litigation, Company will pay as much of the administration and arbitrator 
fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being 
cost-prohibitive as compared to litigation. If the arbitrator determines the 
claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous or that you asserted the 
claim(s) for harassment or any other improper purpose, you agree to reimburse 
Company for all administration and arbitrator fees paid by Company. The party 
that ultimately loses will pay the reasonable documented attorneys’ fees and 
costs of both parties.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">The arbitration shall be held in Detroit, Michigan, in English. If the value of 
the relief sought is $25,000 USD or less, the arbitration will be conducted 
based solely on written submissions; provided however, either of us may request 
to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or in-person hearing, which request 
shall be subject to the arbitrator's discretion. Attendance at any in-person hearing 
may be made by telephone by you and/or us, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. 
Keeping in mind that arbitration must remain a fast and economical process, no 
discovery or exchange of information between us is contemplated. Upon request by 
either of us, the arbitrator may direct specific information be exchanged and may 
issue a protective order limiting the use and disclosure of exchanged information; 
provided however, the scope of information the arbitrator may direct to be exchanged 
shall be limited to what the arbitrator determines is needed to provide for a 
fundamentally fair process. Either party may file a dispositive motion to narrow 
the issues. </FONT>
