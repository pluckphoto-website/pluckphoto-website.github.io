&ldquo;Products&rdquo;), as well as references and links to Products.
Such Products may be made available by Company or by third parties.
The availability through the Service of any listing, description, or
image of a Product made available by third parties does not imply our
endorsement of such Product or affiliation with the provider of such
Product. Company may be compensated if you click on a link and
purchase one or more Products recommended to you through the Service
or in an email, blog, or other online posting sponsored by us. In
addition, some of the endorsements made on the Service, or on our
affiliates&rsquo; sites, may be made by persons who have a financial
or other interest in Company or our Products. We make no
representations as to the completeness, accuracy, or timeliness of
such listings, descriptions or images (including any features,
specifications, and prices contained therein, or the accurate display
of the details of Products on your mobile device or computer screen).
Such information and the availability of any Product (including the
validity of any coupon or discount) is subject to change at any time
without notice. Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions
are approximate and are for convenience only. We make reasonable
efforts to accurately display the attributes of Products, including

    <h3>Transactions</h3>
    <FONT COLOR="#000000">
We may make available the ability to purchase or otherwise obtain
certain Products through the Service (a &ldquo;Transaction&rdquo;).
If you wish to make a Transaction, you may be asked to supply certain
relevant information, such as details regarding your method of
payment (e.g., your credit or debit card number and its expiration
date, or select your payment service (e.g., PayPal)), your billing
address, and your shipping information. You represent and warrant
that you have the right to use any method of payment that you submit
in connection with a Transaction (e.g., credit card, debit card, or
payment service). By submitting such information, you grant to us the
right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of
facilitating Transactions. Verification of information may be
required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any
Transaction. By making a Transaction, you represent that the
applicable Products will be used only in a lawful manner.</FONT>

    <FONT COLOR="#000000">Company
reserves the right, including without prior notice, to limit the

impose conditions on the honoring of any coupon, discount, or similar
promotion; to bar any user from making any Transaction; and to refuse
to provide any user with any Product (including in connection with
any Submission that Company, in its sole discretion, believes is in
violation of this Agreement). Without limiting the foregoing, Company
reserves the right to cancel any order that it deems, in its sole
discretion, to include objectionable content or that may violate any
of the terms of this Agreement, without any liability to you or any
third party. In the event of any such cancellation, you will be
refunded any amount actually received by Company for the cancelled
order, less any applicable fees. You agree to pay all charges
incurred by you or on your behalf through the Service, at the prices
in effect when such charges are incurred, including all shipping and
handling charges. In addition, you are responsible for any taxes
applicable to your Transactions. While it is our practice to confirm
orders by e-mail, the receipt of an e-mail order confirmation does
not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an
offer to sell a product or service. Products will be shipped to an
address designated by you, if applicable, so long as such address is
complete and complies with the shipping restrictions contained on the
Service. All Transactions are made pursuant to a shipment contract
and, as a result, risk of loss and title for physical Products pass
to you upon delivery of such Products to the carrier (who is not
affiliated with, or controlled by, Company) and, for electronic
Products, risk of loss and title pass to you upon purchase of such
Products. You are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for
damaged and/or lost shipments.</FONT>

    <h3>Limited Warranty and Returns</h3>
    <FONT COLOR="#000000"> Company offers

free of material defects. In the event that your Product has material
defects, Company may replace such Product at no cost to you. To be
eligible for a replacement Product, you must contact our customer
service team through our help center (www.pluckphoto.com/help) to
notify them within fourteen (14) days of receiving your Product.
Company reserves the right to request the return of the defective
Product to verify that such Product is defective and eligible for a
return under this limited warranty. There is no redeemable cash value
for returned Products. Due to the custom and personalized nature of
our Products, Company will not replace Products in connection with
any user error or creative choice. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is important that you carefully proof the content and order details
of your Products for the following: (a) poor image quality including
low resolution images that may be insufficient for print; (b) text
errors including mistakes in spelling, grammar, font choice or other
text errors or omissions; (c) Product selection mistakes including
Product type, size, style, color, and design layout; and (d)
accidental omissions including blank pages or empty photo boxes. You
should also note that image colors vary from computer monitor to

that might result from computer screen differences or differences
between the colors on your computer monitor and the colors on a
Product that was created by professionally calibrated printing
systems.</FONT>

    <h3>Gift Cards</h3>
    <FONT COLOR="#000000"> Gift cards made available
through the Service, either in electronic or physical format (&ldquo;Gift
Cards&rdquo;), may solely be purchased and redeemed through the Site.
Each Gift Card will include a gift code (&ldquo;Gift Code&rdquo;)
associated with a redeemable monetary value to be applied to amounts
payable for Products when such Gift Code is entered during the
checkout process on the Site. A Gift Card holder can determine such
Gift Card&rsquo;s remaining balance and applicable currency by
entering the Gift Code in the &ldquo;Redeem Gift Card&rdquo; section
under &ldquo;My Account&rdquo; menu found on the Site or by
contacting our help center (www.pluckphoto.com/help). Gift Cards may
not be used toward prior Product purchases. &nbsp;Every Product
purchase made with a Gift Card (including applicable costs, such as
shipping and handling and taxes) is deducted from the Gift Card
balance. &nbsp;Gift Card balances will be applied against the total
amount of the order placed. &nbsp;If any purchase exceeds the Gift
Card balance, the excess amount must be paid with another payment
method accepted on the Site. Gift Card balances cannot be used to
purchase other Gift Cards and may only be used to purchase Products
being offered for sale in the same currency used on the Gift Card.
You may change the currency used on the Site by using the site
selector located in the upper-right hand corner of the Site. The
currency of a Gift Card cannot be changed after the Gift Card is
issued or purchased. Any unused Gift Card balance will remain on the
Gift Card account. Gift Cards have no expiration date and Pluckphoto
does not charge any fees for Gift Cards.</FONT>
</P>
<P>
    <FONT COLOR="#000000">Gift
Cards cannot be reloaded or recharged, and balances on multiple Gift
Cards cannot be combined into a combined balance on one or more new
Gift Cards. &nbsp;Gift Cards cannot be used to purchase other gift
cards. Except to the extent required by applicable law, Gift Cards
may not be transferred for value, resold, or redeemed for cash or
checks, and Gift Card balances cannot be transferred to credit card
accounts or any other means of payment. Unused Gift Card balances in
a Service account may not be transferred to another Service account.
To the extent that applicable law requires us to redeem Gift Cards
for monetary value, Company reserves the right to pay the Gift Card
holder the remaining balance by any means we choose (e.g., cash,
check, etc.).</FONT>
</P>
<P>
    <FONT COLOR="#000000">If
we believe that a Gift Card is used, redeemed or obtained
fraudulently, we reserve the right to reject the redemption or use of
such Gift Card, use alternative means of payment provided by the Gift
Card holder, terminate the applicable account, and/or take available
legal actions. You can report misplaced Gift Cards by contacting our
help center (www.pluckphoto.com/help), but we are not responsible if
any Gift Card is lost, stolen, destroyed or used without your
permission.</FONT>
